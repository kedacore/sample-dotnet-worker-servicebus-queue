# .NET Core worker processing Azure Service Bus Queue scaled by KEDA with connection strings
A simple Docker container written in .NET that will receive messages from a Service Bus queue and scale via KEDA with connection strings.

The message processor will receive a single message at a time (per instance), and sleep for 2 second to simulate performing work. When adding a massive amount of queue messages, KEDA will drive the container to scale out according to the event source (Service Bus Queue).

> üí° *If you want to learn how to scale this sample with KEDA 1.0, feel free to read about it [here](https://github.com/kedacore/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue/tree/keda-v1.0).*

_The sample can also be ran locally on Docker without KEDA, read our [documentation here](./src/)._

## A closer look at our KEDA Scaling

This is defined via the `ScaledObject` which is deployed along with our application.

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: order-processor-scaler
  labels:
    app: order-processor
    deploymentName: order-processor
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: order-processor
  # minReplicaCount: 0 Change to define how many minimum replicas you want
  maxReplicaCount: 10
  triggers:
  - type: azure-servicebus
    metadata:
      queueName: orders
      queueLength: '5'
    authenticationRef:
      name: trigger-auth-service-bus-orders
```

It defines the type of scale trigger we'd like to use, in our case `azure-servicebus`, and the scaling criteria. For our scenario we'd like to scale out if there are 5 or more messages in the `orders` queue with a maximum of 10 concurrent replicas which is defined via `maxReplicaCount`.

Next to that, it is referring to `trigger-auth-service-bus-orders` which is a `TriggerAuthentication` resource that defines how KEDA should authenticate to get the metrics:

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: trigger-auth-service-bus-orders
spec:
  secretTargetRef:
  - parameter: connection
    name: secrets-order-management
    key: servicebus-order-management-connectionstring
```

In this case, we are telling KEDA to read the `connection` parameter from a Kubernetes secret with the name `secrets-order-management` and pass the value of the entry with key `servicebus-order-management-connectionstring`.

This allows us to not only re-use this authentication resource but also assign different permissions to KEDA than our app itself.

## Pre-requisites

- Azure CLI
- Azure Subscription
- .NET Core 3.0
- Kubernetes cluster with [KEDA v2.0+ installed](https://keda.sh/docs/2.0/deploy/)

## Setup

This setup will go through creating an Azure Service Bus queue  and deploying this consumer with the `ScaledObject` to scale via KEDA.  If you already have an Azure Service Bus namespace you can use your existing queues.

### Creating a new Azure Service Bus namespace & queue

We will start by creating a new Azure Service Bus namespace:

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus namespace create --name <namespace-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --sku basic
```

After that, we create an `orders` queue in our namespace:

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus queue create --namespace-name <namespace-name> --name orders --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

We need to be able to connect to our queue, so we create a new authorization rule with `Listen` permissions which our app will use to process messages.

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus queue authorization-rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --queue-name orders --name order-consumer --rights Listen
```

Once the authorization rule is created, we can list the connection string as following:

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus queue authorization-rule keys list --resource-group <resource-group-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --queue-name orders --name order-consumer
{
  "aliasPrimaryConnectionString": null,
  "aliasSecondaryConnectionString": null,
  "keyName": "order-consumer",
  "primaryConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://keda.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=order-consumer;SharedAccessKey=<redacted>;EntityPath=orders",
  "primaryKey": "<redacted>",
  "secondaryConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://keda.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=order-consumer;SharedAccessKey=<redacted>;EntityPath=orders",
  "secondaryKey": "<redacted>"
}
```

Create a base64 representation of the connection string and update our Kubernetes secret in `deploy/deploy-app.yaml`:

```cli
‚ùØ echo -n "<connection string>" | base64
```

### Deploying our order processor

We will start by creating a new Kubernetes namespace to run our order processor in:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl create namespace keda-dotnet-sample
namespace "keda-dotnet-sample" created
```

Before we can connect to our queue, we need to create a secret which contains the Service Bus connection string to the queue.

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f deploy/deploy-app.yaml --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
deployment.apps/order-processor created
secret/secrets-order-consumer created
```

Once created, you should be able to retrieve the secret:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get secrets --namespace keda-dotnet-sample

NAME                  TYPE                                  DATA      AGE
secrets-order-consumer         Opaque                                1         24s
```

Next to that, you will see that our deployment shows up with one pods created:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get deployments --namespace keda-dotnet-sample -o wide
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       CONTAINERS        IMAGES                                                   SELECTOR
order-processor   1         1         1           1           49s       order-processor   kedasamples/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue   app=order-processor
```

### Deploying our autoscaling

First things first, we will create a new authorization rule with `Management` permissions so that KEDA can monitor it.

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus queue authorization-rule create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --queue-name orders --name keda-monitor --rights Manage Send Listen
```

Get and encode the connection string as mentioned above and store it in `servicebus-order-management-connectionstring` for our secret in `deploy-autoscaling.yaml`.

We have our secret configured, defined a `TriggerAuthentication` for KEDA to authenticate with and defined how our app should scale with a `ScaledObject` - We are ready to go!

Now let's create everything:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f .\deploy\deploy-autoscaling.yaml --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
triggerauthentication.keda.sh/trigger-auth-service-bus-orders created
secret/secrets-order-consumer configured
scaledobject.keda.sh/order-processor-scaler created
```

Once created, you will see that our deployment shows up with no pods created:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get deployments --namespace keda-dotnet-sample -o wide
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       CONTAINERS        IMAGES                                                   SELECTOR
order-processor   0         0         0            0           49s       order-processor   kedasamples/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue   app=order-processor
```

This is because our queue is empty and KEDA scaled it down until there is work to do.

In that case, let's give generate some!

## Publishing messages to the queue

The following job will send messages to the "orders" queue on which the order processor is listening to. As the queue builds up, KEDA will help the horizontal pod autoscaler add more and more pods until the queue is drained. The order generator will allow you to specify how many messages you want to queue.

First you should clone the project:

```cli
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/kedacore/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue
‚ùØ cd sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue
```

Configure a connection string with `Send` permissions in the tool via your favorite text editor, in this case via Visual Studio Code:

```cli
‚ùØ code .\src\Keda.Samples.Dotnet.OrderGenerator\Program.cs
```

Next, you can run the order generator via the CLI:

```cli
‚ùØ dotnet run --project .\src\Keda.Samples.Dotnet.OrderGenerator\Keda.Samples.Dotnet.OrderGenerator.csproj
Let's queue some orders, how many do you want?
300
Queuing order 719a7b19-f1f7-4f46-a543-8da9bfaf843d - A Hat for Reilly Davis
Queuing order 5c3a954c-c356-4cc9-b1d8-e31cd2c04a5a - A Salad for Savanna Rowe
[...]

That's it, see you later!
```

Now that the messages are generated, you'll see that KEDA starts automatically scaling out your deployment:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get deployments --namespace keda-dotnet-sample -o wide
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       CONTAINERS        IMAGES                                                   SELECTOR
order-processor   8         8         8            4           4m        order-processor   kedasamples/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue   app=order-processor
```

Eventually we will have 10 pods running processing messages in parallel:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get pods --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
order-processor-65d5dd564-9wbph   1/1       Running   0          54s

order-processor-65d5dd564-h2l5l   1/1       Running   0          54s
order-processor-65d5dd564-h6fcl   1/1       Running   0          24s
order-processor-65d5dd564-httnf   1/1       Running   0          1m
order-processor-65d5dd564-j64wq   1/1       Running   0          54s
order-processor-65d5dd564-ncwfd   1/1       Running   0          39s
order-processor-65d5dd564-q7tkt   1/1       Running   0          39s
order-processor-65d5dd564-t2g6x   1/1       Running   0          24s
order-processor-65d5dd564-v79x6   1/1       Running   0          39s
```

You can look at the logs for a given processor as following:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl logs order-processor-65d5dd564-httnf --namespace keda-dotnet-sample

## Visualizing the service bus queue

There is also a web application included in the repository that shows a simple bar chart with the number of messages. The graph refreshes every 2 seconds, giving you a visualization how the queue initially builds up when orders are being sent to the service bus, and then when the autoscaler kicks in the queue will decrease in length quicker and quicker depending on how many replicas that have been created.


To build and run the web app locally, add the service bus connection string to appSettings.json and run the web application from Visual Studio.

There is also a docker image available, so you can also run it locally with the following command:

```cli
docker run -p 8080:80 -d -e OrderQueue__ConnectionString="KEDA_SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_CONNECTIONSTRING" kedasamples/sample-dotnet-web 
```

To deploy the web application to your Kubernetes cluster:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f .\deploy\deploy-web.yaml --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
deployment.apps/order-web created
service/kedasampleweb created
```

Get the public IP by running:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get svc kedasampleweb --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
kedasampleweb   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.60   52.157.87.179   80:30919/TCP   117s
```

You'll need to wait a short while until the public IP is created and shown in the output.
