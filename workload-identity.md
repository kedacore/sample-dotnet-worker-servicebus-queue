# .NET Core worker processing Azure Service Bus Queue scaled by KEDA with Azure AD Workload Identity
A simple Docker container written in .NET that will receive messages from a Service Bus queue and scale via KEDA with Azure AD Workload Identity.

![Scenario](./images/workload-identity-scenario.png)

> üí° *If you want to learn how to scale this sample with KEDA 1.0, feel free to read about it [here](https://github.com/kedacore/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue/tree/keda-v1.0).*

_The sample can also be ran locally on Docker without KEDA, read our [documentation here](./src/)._

## A closer look at our KEDA Scaling

This is defined via the `ScaledObject` which is deployed along with our application.

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScaledObject
metadata:
  name: order-processor-scaler
  labels:
    app: order-processor
    name: order-processor
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    name: order-processor
  # minReplicaCount: 0 Change to define how many minimum replicas you want
  maxReplicaCount: 10
  triggers:
  - type: azure-servicebus
    metadata:
      namespace: keda-demos
      queueName: orders
      queueLength: '5'
    authenticationRef:
      name: trigger-auth-service-bus-orders
```

It defines the type of scale trigger we'd like to use, in our case `azure-servicebus`, and the scaling criteria. For our scenario we'd like to scale out if there are 5 or more messages in the `orders` queue in the `keda-demos` namespace with a maximum of 10 concurrent replicas which is defined via `maxReplicaCount`.

Next to that, it is referring to `trigger-auth-service-bus-orders` which is a `TriggerAuthentication` resource that defines how KEDA should authenticate to get the metrics:

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: trigger-auth-service-bus-orders
spec:
  podIdentity:
    provider: azure-workload
```

In this case, we are telling KEDA to use Azure Workload as a pod identity provider. Under the hood, it will use [Azure AD Workload Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity).

This allows us to not only re-use this authentication resource but also assign different permissions to KEDA than our app itself by assigning another Azure AD App to KEDA.

## Pre-requisites

- Azure CLI
- Azure Subscription
- .NET Core 3.0
- Kubernetes cluster with [Azure AD Workload Identity](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity) installed

> üí° *Ensure that a public OIDC issuer URL and webhook has been setup for your cluster as per the [documentation](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/installation.html).*
>
> For an AKS Cluster this involves:
> - Registering the [`EnableOIDCIssuerPreview`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#register-the-enableoidcissuerpreview-feature-flag) feature flag for your Azure subscription.
> - Enabling the [`OIDC issuer`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#update-an-aks-cluster-with-oidc-issuer) for your cluster.
> - Obtaining the [`issuer url`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#show-the-oidc-issuer-url).
> - Installing the [`webhook`](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/installation/mutating-admission-webhook.html).

## Setup

This setup will go through creating an Azure Service Bus queue  and deploying this consumer with the `ScaledObject` to scale via KEDA.  If you already have an Azure Service Bus namespace you can use your existing queues.

## Creating Azure AD Applications

We will first create two Azure AD applications:

- An application for our order processor to authenticate with
- An application for KEDA to authenticate with

This can easily be done by using `az ad app create` in the Azure CLI, for example:

```cli
‚ùØ az ad app create --display-name <app-name> --native-app --required-resource-accesses @deploy/workload-identity/manifest.json
{
  "acceptMappedClaims": null,
  "addIns": [],
  "allowGuestsSignIn": null,
  "allowPassthroughUsers": null,
  "appId": "<app-id>",
  "appLogoUrl": null,
  "appPermissions": null,
  "appRoles": [],
  "applicationTemplateId": null,
  "availableToOtherTenants": false,
  "deletionTimestamp": null,
  "displayName": "order-processor",
  "errorUrl": null,
  "groupMembershipClaims": null,
  "homepage": null,
  "identifierUris": [],
  "informationalUrls": {
    "marketing": null,
    "privacy": null,
    "support": null,
    "termsOfService": null
  },
  // [...]
}
```

Make sure to create the apps for our order processor and KEDA. For each of the applications, you need to copy the following information -

- `appId` - Represents the application / client ID of the Azure AD application.
- `objectId` - Represents the object ID of the Azure AD application.

Next, we create the underlying service principle for the applications.
```cli
‚ùØ az ad sp create --id <app-id>
{
  "accountEnabled": "True",
  "addIns": [],
  "alternativeNames": [],
  "appDisplayName": "order-processor",
  "appId": "<app-id>",
  // [...]
  "objectId": "<service-principle-object-id>",
  // [...]
}
```

For each of the service principles, copy the following information -

- `objectId` - Represents the object ID of the service principle used by our Azure AD Application.

### Creating a new Azure Service Bus namespace & queue

We will start by creating a new Azure Service Bus namespace:

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus namespace create --name <namespace-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --sku basic
```

After that, we create an `orders` queue in our namespace:

```cli
‚ùØ az servicebus queue create --namespace-name <namespace-name> --name orders --resource-group <resource-group-name>
```

Now that we have an Azure Service Bus namespace we can grant our order-processor Azure AD App `Azure Service Bus Data Receiver` role on our namespace so that it can process messages:

```cli
‚ùØ az role assignment create --role 'Azure Service Bus Data Receiver' --assignee <service-principle-object-id> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/<namespace-name>
```

## Deploying our order processor

We will start by creating a new Kubernetes namespace to run our order processor in:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl create namespace keda-dotnet-sample
namespace "keda-dotnet-sample" created
```

First, we need to update our `deploy-app-with-workload-identity.yaml` which will create our Kubernetes deployment along with the authentication information for Azure AD Workload Identity.

Before we can deploy our app, we need to replace the placeholders in  `deploy-app-with-workload-identity.yaml` with the values for your Azure AD application.

Once that is done, we can now easily deploy our application to Kubernetes:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f deploy/workload-identity/deploy-app-with-workload-identity.yaml --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
serviceaccount/order-processor-sa created
deployment.apps/order-processor created
```

You will see that our deployment shows up with one pods created:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get deployments --namespace keda-dotnet-sample -o wide
NAME              READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE   CONTAINERS        IMAGES                                        SELECTOR
order-processor   1/1     1            1           48s   order-processor   kedasamples/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue   app=order-processor
```

## Creating federated credentials between our service account and Azure AD

We need to have our Azure AD applications trust the tokens issued by our service account. This can be done through the CLI.

First, update the `deploy/workload-identity/federate-body.json` file with the information with the appropriate information
for your cluster and service account `order-processor-sa`. 

After updating, run the following command - 

```cli
‚ùØ az rest --method POST --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/<application-object-id>/federatedIdentityCredentials" --body @deploy/workload-identity/federate-body.json
```

## Installing KEDA

With everything in place, we can [install KEDA v2.8+](https://keda.sh/docs/2.8/deploy/) with Helm.

First, add the KEDA Helm repo and update it:

```cli
> helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
> helm repo update
```

Next, we'll create a namespace for KEDA and install the Helm chart where we specify our autoscaler identity id:

```cli
> kubectl create namespace keda-system
> helm install keda kedacore/keda \
      --set podIdentity.azureWorkload.enabled=true \
      --set podIdentity.azureWorkload.clientId={app-id-for-keda-azure-ad-app} \
      --set podIdentity.azureWorkload.tenantId={tenant-id-for-keda-azure-ad-app} \
      --namespace keda-system
```

We are asking KEDA to use the client ID and tenant ID for the Azure AD application we created earlier when using Workload
Identity.

Repeat the step for creating federated credentials using the service account created for keda.

We're ready to scale our app!

## Deploying our autoscaling

First things first, we will grant the Azure AD application for KEDA required permissions on our Azure Service Bus namespace to be able to query the metrics.

We will assign `Azure Service Bus Data Receiver` role to our autoscaler app given it needs more control for monitoring our namespace:

```cli
‚ùØ az role assignment create --role 'Azure Service Bus Data Owner' --assignee <service-principle-object-id> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/<namespace-name>
```

Last but not least, edit `deploy-app-autoscaling.yaml` to configure your correct Azure Service Bus namespace by replacing `<namespace-name>` with the name so that KEDA can watch its metrics.

Now that we have our Azure AD application configured, we can use the identity in a `TriggerAuthentication` as following:

```yaml
apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: trigger-auth-service-bus-orders
spec:
  podIdentity:
    provider: azure-workload
```

This tells KEDA to authenticate to Azure Service Bus by using Managed Identity, which will be using Azure AD Workload Identity, to be able to query the metrics. With that KEDA can scale our app based on our defined `ScaledObject` - We are ready to go!

Now let's create everything:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f .\deploy\workload-identity\deploy-app-autoscaling.yaml --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
triggerauthentication.keda.sh/trigger-auth-service-bus-orders created
scaledobject.keda.sh/order-scaler created
```

Once created, you will see that our deployment shows up with no pods created:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get deployments --namespace keda-dotnet-sample -o wide
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       CONTAINERS        IMAGES                                                   SELECTOR
order-processor   0         0         0            0           49s       order-processor   kedasamples/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue   app=order-processor
```

This is because our queue is empty and KEDA scaled it down until there is work to do.

In that case, let's give generate some!

## Publishing messages to the queue

The following job will send messages to the "orders" queue on which the order processor is listening to. As the queue builds up, KEDA will help the horizontal pod autoscaler add more and more pods until the queue is drained. The order generator will allow you to specify how many messages you want to queue.

First you should clone the project:

```cli
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/kedacore/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue
‚ùØ cd sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue
```

Configure a connection string with `Send` permissions in the tool via your favorite text editor, in this case via Visual Studio Code:

```cli
‚ùØ code .\src\Keda.Samples.Dotnet.OrderGenerator\Program.cs
```

Next, you can run the order generator via the CLI:

```cli
‚ùØ dotnet run --project .\src\Keda.Samples.Dotnet.OrderGenerator\Keda.Samples.Dotnet.OrderGenerator.csproj
Let's queue some orders, how many do you want?
300
Queuing order 719a7b19-f1f7-4f46-a543-8da9bfaf843d - A Hat for Reilly Davis
Queuing order 5c3a954c-c356-4cc9-b1d8-e31cd2c04a5a - A Salad for Savanna Rowe
[...]

That's it, see you later!
```

Now that the messages are generated, you'll see that KEDA starts automatically scaling out your deployment:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get deployments --namespace keda-dotnet-sample -o wide
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE       CONTAINERS        IMAGES                                                   SELECTOR
order-processor   8         8         8            4           4m        order-processor   kedasamples/sample-dotnet-worker-servicebus-queue   app=order-processor
```

Eventually we will have 10 pods running processing messages in parallel:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get pods --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
order-processor-65d5dd564-9wbph   1/1       Running   0          54s
order-processor-65d5dd564-czlqb   1/1       Running   0          39s
order-processor-65d5dd564-h2l5l   1/1       Running   0          54s
order-processor-65d5dd564-h6fcl   1/1       Running   0          24s
order-processor-65d5dd564-httnf   1/1       Running   0          1m
order-processor-65d5dd564-j64wq   1/1       Running   0          54s
order-processor-65d5dd564-ncwfd   1/1       Running   0          39s
order-processor-65d5dd564-q7tkt   1/1       Running   0          39s
order-processor-65d5dd564-t2g6x   1/1       Running   0          24s
order-processor-65d5dd564-v79x6   1/1       Running   0          39s
```

You can look at the logs for a given processor as following:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl logs order-processor-65d5dd564-httnf --namespace keda-dotnet-sample

## Visualizing the service bus queue

There is also a web application included in the repository that shows a simple bar chart with the number of messages. The graph refreshes every 2 seconds, giving you a visualization how the queue initially builds up when orders are being sent to the service bus, and then when the autoscaler kicks in the queue will decrease in length quicker and quicker depending on how many replicas that have been created.


To build and run the web app locally, add the service bus connection string to appSettings.json and run the web application from Visual Studio.

There is also a docker image available, so you can also run it locally with the following command:

```cli
docker run -p 8080:80 -d -e OrderQueue__ConnectionString="KEDA_SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_CONNECTIONSTRING" kedasamples/sample-dotnet-web 
```

To deploy the web application to your Kubernetes cluster:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl apply -f .\deploy\deploy-web.yaml --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
deployment.apps/order-web created
service/kedasampleweb created
```

Get the public IP by running:

```cli
‚ùØ kubectl get svc kedasampleweb --namespace keda-dotnet-sample
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
kedasampleweb   LoadBalancer   10.0.37.60   52.157.87.179   80:30919/TCP   117s
```

You'll need to wait a short while until the public IP is created and shown in the output.
